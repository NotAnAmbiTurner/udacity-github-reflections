How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    Reduced the amount of text to sift through.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could go back and see what I did at various times. It would allow me to more easily roll-back to previous versions if something I tried didn't work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Forgetfullness vs. Saving full versions of the files

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Depends on their purpose - in GIT, many files have to work together (reference one-another), so it makes little sense to save incremental updates to each file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log tells you the history of the file, with comments. git diff allows you to view those changes - so you can see, for example, what code was changed to 'revert controls'

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can explore deep changes to the code without fear, because a roll-back will allow you to save it. Also, you can incrementally work on major changes as a branch.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
